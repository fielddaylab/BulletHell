BulletHell
==========

A hell. Made of boolets.

"Bullet Hell" games are a sub-genre of "Shoot 'Em Up" games (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up), particularly in which you fly around trying to avoid bullets while simultaneously trying to kill baddies. In this game, you control the spaceship using a mobile phone, while viewing the game on a desktop/laptop browser. Any questions can be directed to either of us (mutschlechne  *OR*   melutzke , both of which are @ wisc dot EDU ). Thanks, and enjoy! This was made at a 16-hour, two-day Hackathon at UW MLI.


To install/use:

1. run "npm install" while in the node folder, as this will resolve all required dependencies. (package.json FTW)

2. Edit the IP address and (optionally) port found in several files (node/test.js, node/phone.html, node/static/main.js)

3. run "node node/test.js" while in the root folder, or "node test.js" while in the node folder to start the server.

4. Load (your IP address):(your port) on the computer, and (your IP address):(your port)/phone.html on a phone 

5. Enjoy.
