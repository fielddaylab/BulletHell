==========

A hell. Made of boolets.


To install/use:
1. run "npm install" while in the node folder, as this will resolve all required dependencies.
2. Edit the IP address and/or port found in several files (node/test.js, node/phone.html, node/static/main.js)
3. run "node node/test.js" while in the root folder, or "node test.js" while in the node folder to start the server.
4. Load <your IP address>:<your port> on the computer, and <your IP address>:<your port>/phone.html on the phone
5. Enjoy.
